# Pokedex

A pokedex app using the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/). This project was created for a technical challenge.

## Description

The main application is a SPA using Next and React. The main feature is a dashboard with a list off all pokemons, and a single page with most information about a selected Pokemon. As an extra feature, I added the following aspects:

-
-
-

## Local Development

To run the project locally, fork the repository and clone it to your local machine. Then, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

There is no need for .env files since all the API is public.
